# CS4375-Assignment-1
Linear Regression using Gradient Descent


This repository contains code for my Linear Regression assignment divided into Part 1 (implemented manually) and Part 2 (implemented using Scikit-Learn).
For easier access, go to this link to view and run this assignment: [Assignment1_Linear_Regression_using_Gradient_Descent](https://github.com/yvonne-hsiao/Assignment1_Linear_Regression_using_Gradient_Descent/tree/main)

## Dataset

The dataset used in this assignment is the "Wine Quality" dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. Specifically, the red wine dataset is used. This dataset comprises physicochemical tests and quality ratings for red wines. Various attributes such as acidity, sugar, pH, alcohol content, etc., are given, and the aim is to predict the wine quality based on these attributes.
The dataset is available at the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/186/wine+quality).<br><br>
For the purpose of this assignment, the dataset is also hosted on GitHub for easy access. The link to the dataset is [here](https://github.com/yvonne-hsiao/Assignment1_Linear_Regression/blob/main/winequality-red.csv)<br>
